# library-app [view live](https://ginnerzapata.github.io/library-app/)

A library app following I made as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

## Requirements

- A _render()_ function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- A form that allows user to add new books
- A delete button.
- A button to handle the read status of the book

## Object Constructors

The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and
being able to reduce the code by doing so.

## LocalStorage

I was asked to do it locally but it was a fine opportunity to learn and apply
LocalStorage. I learned about the basics of it using the Mozilla documentation
and also learned about JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods which made handling the
data extremely easy.
